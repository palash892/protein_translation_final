# Protein Translation Can Fluidize Bacterial Cytoplasm

Welcome to the repository for the research project titled **"Protein Translation Can Fluidize Bacterial Cytoplasm."** This collection of scripts and input files explores various aspects of cytoplasm dynamics during protein translation. The simulations in presence of spherocylindrical confinement were conducted using the open-source software [Gromacs](http://www.gromacs.org/) (Abraham et al., SoftwareX, 2015). We have modified the source code to introduce the spherocylindrical confinement. One can download the modified version of Gromacs at the following link: https://github.com/JMLab-tifrh/gromacs_spherocylinder. The simulations inside the cubical box were conducted using the same Softwares with 2019 version.

### 1. segregation
This folder contains the scripts and input files for DNA ribosome segregation.

### 2. Crowding
In the **"crowding"** folder, you will find scripts and input files focused on studying the glassy dynamics of different particles in the presence of crowders. Gain insights into how crowding influences the behavior of various molecular components.

### 3. Switch
This folder contains the scripts and input files to study the effect of polysome ribosome conversion on glassy dynamics of bacterial cytoplasm.

🔍 Key Findings:

- Size-dependent spatial organization in the cytoplasm arises from entropic segregation of ribosomes and DNA.
- Ribosomal transitions during protein synthesis enhance cytoplasmic fluidity by counteracting glassy dynamics.
- Protein synthesis, the largest consumer of ATP, plays a central role in maintaining cytoplasmic fluidity in active bacterial cells.
